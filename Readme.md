# Learn_about_me 📱
Small socialmedia fullstack web application.<br>
used for :
* **front end** : React,framermotion,cropperjs,styledComponent .
* **back end** : nodejs,Express,mongoDb,passportjs

This application is my first app I did it while I was follwing [Express in Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27131471-express-in-action) book.

Note: there is a huge differnece between the my app the project in the book since I am using react and I can't make SSR without next.js
